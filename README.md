# Serverless Autocorrect Security Groups

This repo contains Terraform modules and scripts that help you to monitor and revert changes in the Inbound & Outbound rules of your Security Groups. Any newly added Inbound & Outbound rules will be revoked automatically and notifications will be sent out.

## Prerequisites

1. Cloudtrail is enabled in your environment.
2. Install Terraform. Refer to [here](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
3. awscli is configured in your environment. Terraform will use your awscli credentials to create the environment.
4. The repo will not work for cross-region. You need to deploy this repo to all regions that you want to monitor. 


## Architecture

A serverless architecture with AWS CloudTrail, EventBridge, Lambda and SNS will be used.

## How to run

1. Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/liamvu2501/tf-aws-autocorrect-sg.git
```

2. Create a **terraform.tfvars** file in the same directory of the **main.tf** and fill in your info. Refer to **terraform.tfvars.example** in this repo as an example


3. This repo will use your awscli "default" profile. If you want to change it, please open **provider.tf** and modify `profile = "default"` to `profile = "yourprofile"`. Make sure to use the profile that has appropriate permissions to create the environment

You can also change the region to deploy this repo. Open **provider.tf** and modify `region  = "us-east-2"` to `region  = "yourregion"` . Make sure to match the `region` in **provider.tf** with the `region` in your **terraform.tfvars**


3. At the root of the repo/folder, init your environment:

```bash
terraform init
```

4. Plan and apply:

```bash
terraform plan
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

5. Check the email that you specify in the **terraform.tfvars** in step 2 and confirm the subscription


6. Sit back, relax and let Lambda does the heavy work
